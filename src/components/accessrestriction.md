Please perform a code review of the following files:
- App.tsx
- App.css
- RestrictedAccessScreen.tsx
- UsersTab.tsx
- AuthContext.tsx

Your primary objective is as follows:

1. **Type Safety and Error Checking:**
   - Identify any type errors or potential bugs in the TypeScript files.
   - Ensure that all components, props, states, and functions are strictly and correctly typed according to best practices in TypeScript and React.

2. **Type-Focused Refactoring:**
   - Refactor the code where necessary to resolve type errors and simplify type declarations.
   - Improve clarity, reduce redundant type assertions, and ensure consistent use of TypeScript throughout the codebase while preserving exact functionality.

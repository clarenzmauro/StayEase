   - Remove any redundant logic or unnecessary complexity.
   - Optimize the component structures and ensure modularity for easier maintenance.

2. **Type Safety and Error Checking:**
   - Identify any type errors or potential bugs within the TypeScript files.
   - Ensure that all components, props, and states are strictly typed.
   - Validate that the code adheres to best practices in TypeScript and React.

3. **Code Organization and Maintainability:**
   - Improve readability by applying consistent coding styles and conventions.
   - Organize CSS classes for consistency and efficiency.
   - Optimize the overall code structure regarding performance and reusability.

4. **Documentation and Explanation:**
   - Provide detailed explanations for each change made.
   - Clarify how the refactoring improves code readability, maintainability, and safety.
   - Include comments in the refactored code where appropriate to highlight key improvements.

Please review all the files against these criteria, refactor the code accordingly, and present the updated, simplified versions along with a detailed report of your changes.
